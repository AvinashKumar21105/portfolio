        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          Hi! I'm <span>Avinash Kumar</span>, a Mechanical Engineer with a
          strong passion for technology and software development. I thrive at
          the intersection of machines and code, combining physical systems
          knowledge with computational problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my Mechanical Engineering journey, I mastered concepts of
          design, dynamics, and manufacturing. At the same time, I delved into
          programming and web development, building projects that bridge
          real-world mechanical systems with digital solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that the future of engineering lies in integrating hardware
          and software. Whether itâ€™s automating mechanical processes, developing
          simulation tools, or creating smart solutions, I bring a unique
          perspective that blends mechanics with computing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside the technical world, I am curious, adaptable, and eager to
          learn. I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about innovations,
          and applying creative thinking to solve complex challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to work on projects that require both mechanical and
          computational expertise, turning ideas into practical solutions that
          make a real impact.
        </p>
